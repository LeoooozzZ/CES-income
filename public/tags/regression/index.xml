Abstract: We cannot ignore that income matters for our lives in almost all aspects, including living standards, consumption ideas, and investment preferences. In this analysis, I use two variables related to income in the CES dataset and find that most participants are willing to answer the income question. Because of the importance of income, does it help the candidate during an election year if they can propose some scheme for tackling poverty and inequality income?</description>
